> Wama
> [Ëˆvama] *noun*
> German acronym for *Waschmaschine* (washer)

When iterating during local development, there's a lot of *lather*, *rinse*, *repeat*.
wama does it for you, in the background.

For example, you might often want to run:

1. `devtools::document()`
2. `pkgdown::build_site()`
3. `pkgdown::preview_site()`

and other such workflows.

Existing keyboard shortcuts are a great help, but sometimes even that is too much of a hassle.

For rapid iterations, especially on shiny apps or when polishing the documentation, automatically re-running these steps saves time and helps you stay focused.

wama watches relevant files and folders for changes, and then automatically triggers these jobs in the background.

Important to note:

- wama always runs in the *background*, that is *non-interactively*.
    A lot of development iteration is still better accomplished interactively.
    But even there, you may benefit from an always-up-to-date`man/` and `NAMESPACE`.
- wama is strictly a development-time package; you should never need it in your `DESCRIPTION`.
- wama may be most helpful in an editor or IDE paired with a large screen, where you can view many terminals at once.
    For example [vscode](http://code.visualstudio.com), has great support for multiple terminals, website preview and [R](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r)
